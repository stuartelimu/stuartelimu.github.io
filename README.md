# Stuart Elimu

Hi, I’m [stue](). I am a lead software engineer, techie and [content creator](). 

Currently, I am working on [@KOPSPN](), [Find My Rotary](), among [others](/work). 

Along the way, I am trying to start a couple of [businesses]() in a bid to live a better life and leave an inheritance for my children’s grandchildren. 

I love to listen to audiobooks, travel and consume a lot of content during my free time. 

You can checkout every single article that I have written on my [blog](/blog) cutting across various topics that I am curious about.
