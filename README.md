# Stuart Elimu

Hi, I’m [stue](). I’m a lead software engineer, techie and content creator.

Currently building @KOPSPN, Find My Rotary among [others]()

Along the way, I am trying to start a couple of [businesses]() in a bid to live a better life and leave an inheritance for my children’s grandchildren. 

I love to listen to audiobooks, travel and consume a lot of content during my free time. 

You can checkout every single article that I have written on my [blog]() cutting across various topics that I’m curious about.
