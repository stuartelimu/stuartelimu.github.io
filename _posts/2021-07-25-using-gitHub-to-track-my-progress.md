# Using GitHub To Track My Progress

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41069456/126903197-298fa4d5-48f3-4638-a448-a15bc2044d1b.png)


When I started using GitHub I didn’t know most of the features that were involved. I was focused on learning how to store my code online and access it anywhere. With time I got to learn how to make contributions, create issues and discussions. 

All these activities are recorded on a contribution calender which looks like the one above. You can see what contributions are counted [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-graphs-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#contributions-that-are-counted).

I like to keep a record of how much progress I’ve made in this case learning 

Unlike most people on the internet, I really don’t mind using this 

It keeps me in check and motivated , sometimes I’m a beast and I’d love to see that effort reflecter

I won’t like , at times it weighs ue down when ue feel you’ve not done enough but after piecing yourself together you get to learn something new and go back to your progress report 

This has kept me motivated as I often go back to my previous leanings or hobby projects and I picked some pieces of code that obviously I wouldn’t find on the internet 

This has also made me a better developer and I’m confident with my skills using this tool. 

This is by no way the best metric but it works for me 

I make sure my work progress is not visible to the public but only to me; I sir bakx and I’m look at how much work I’ve gotten done. 

I’ve learned keeping track is such a great way to get things done. 

What metrics are you using ? How are you keeping track of your progress ? I’d love to know. Please share with me @stuartelimu
