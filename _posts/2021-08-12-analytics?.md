# Analytics ?
I’m considering adding analytics to my site, I’m not sure what I’d get but I love stats so I’ll do it. 

I’ll share my lessons on how to make sense of the dashboards, jekyll comes with support for Google analytics though there are so many bad reviews but I’ll give it a try or look for alternatives
