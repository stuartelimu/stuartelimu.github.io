title: My Pocket Alternative
---

Unfortunately, the read-it-later app, Pocket is [shutting down](https://getpocket.com/farewell). We have until October 8, 2025, to migrate all user data after which all of it will be permanently deleted. 

I usually miss these migration deadlines, not because I don't see the reminder emails but it's quite a bit of work. I remember telling myself I'd made a mental note about the Adidas app deadline but I ended up missing it, and now all my data is lost or possibly seated somewhere on a random server. This is my attempt to somehow make up for that. 

This is a version of something I came across in [Issue 169](https://hlry.at/169?ref=hulry.com) of Hulrys newsletter. 

### Introduction 

![344_1x_shots_so](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec8ea5a1-3823-4dca-8483-b840d55c7b29)

I read a lot of articles online and to keep track of what I read I've tried a couple of things, hoard a bunch of tabs open for later, bookmark the tab for later, tweet the article, and I used to write a whole article with a list of everything I'd read the past month. Some of these helped, when I  of what I read here on the blog and manually add links to my notes app - I even post them on Twitter so I can somewhat share with anyone interested but also have a solid record of what I’ve read 

Obviously none of these is sufficient, I actually came back to Pocket early this year but I still couldn’t have everything the way I wanted to. 

I honestly didn’t use Pocket so much like so many people I’ve seen online but I surely fell in love with the startup a while back after reading an [article](https://review.firstround.com/the-story-behind-how-pocket-hit-20m-users-with-20-people/) about how they hit 20M users with just 20 staff. I immediately signed up and since they were acquired by Mozilla it just made everything way easier.

#### Preriquisites
An iPhone, Claude & Apple Reminders

#### Getting Started
This is my first time properly using the Reminders app for something useful so forgive the mess. [Here's](https://www.threads.com/@thehulry/post/DBOg8R9qWeM?utm_source=Hulry) Hulry's well structured approach that uses ChatGPT, I’m late to the party 

Luckily I came across this method basically, he’s providing alternatives to Pocket, this is my version of 


I wanted to go a bit further - remind me a certain ; sometimes I read over breakfast or after work but also sometime it’s to take a break form social media 

#### Bonus 
I usually don’t close tabs because I come across a lot of articles online and I always tell myself I’ll go back to them but often I never will and next thing I know I’ve hit a max 500 tabs on my phone 

then also close the tab -


### Conclusion 
This way, I think I’ll somewhat get to read more but more importantly have an impressive catalogue of articles that I’ve read online - plus somewhat build a system 

More importantly I think this is where AI shines, assist my thinking - maybe my organization
