title: My Pocket Alternative
---

I honestly didn’t use Pocket so much like so many people I’ve seen online but I surely fell in love with the startup a while back after reading an [article](https://review.firstround.com/the-story-behind-how-pocket-hit-20m-users-with-20-people/) about how they hit 20M users with just 20 staff. I immediately signed up and since they were acquired by Mozilla it just made everything way easier.

Unfortunately Pocket is [shutting down](https://getpocket.com/farewell) and I usually miss deadlines etc I missed the Adidas app deadline and all my fitness data is lost or possibly seated somewhere on a server

I read a lot and to keep track of what I read I do a couple of things, hoard a bunch of tabs open for later, bookmark the tab for later, tweet the article, last but not least have a whole article of what I read here on the blog and manually add links to my notes app - I even post them on Twitter so I can somewhat share with anyone interested but also have a solid record of what I’ve read 

Obviously none of these is sufficient, I actually came back to Pocket early this year but I still couldn’t have everything the way I wanted to. 

Luckily I came across this method basically, he’s providing alternatives to Pocket, this is my version of 
This is a version of something I came across in [Issue 169](https://hlry.at/169?ref=hulry.com) of Hulrys newsletter 

This is the first time I’m properly using the Reminders app, I’m late to the party 

I wanted to go a bit further - remind me a certain ; sometimes I read over breakfast or after work but also sometime it’s to take a break form social media 

## Bonus 
I usually don’t close tabs because I come across a lot of articles online and I always tell myself I’ll go back to them but often I never will and next thing I know I’ve hit a max 500 tabs on my phone 

then also close the tab -


## Conclusion 
This way, I think I’ll somewhat get to read more but more importantly have an impressive catalogue of articles that I’ve read online - plus somewhat build a system 

More importantly I think this is where AI shines, assist my thinking - maybe my organization
