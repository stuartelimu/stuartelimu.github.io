I took sometime this morning to dust off this web application I worked on last year. I made a pretty recording that I thought I’d share

I figured i’d jot down some notes to help me think much better.

### Recap

I’ve referenced this else where and maybe you can somewhat read the genesis 

Maybe I’ll let it fly and possibly make me some money in the long run

### Updates
These are mainly subtle 
- Fellowships: The most obvious change is the name. I’d thought about it quite a lot and narrowed down to this
- Search: I’ve taken out search for now since it was not working as expected. I’ll eventually add it back later as the dataset grows 

### Stats
Some stats from April 2023 for the curious:
* 🙋‍♀️ 1 total user: That’s me. This number isn't that helpful, as the product is still in beta and I’ve not quite shared it with lots of people yet but it’ll leave it here.
* 💳 0 paying customers: This includes myself; I'm using Proseful for my personal blog. This number is consistently flat, as I've literally done no "hustling" since last summer. Not my forte. Keep saying I need to get on this.

### Looking forward
Some of the features and improvements I hope to tackle in 2023:
* Projects:  Club projects seem to be quite an important activity and I’m debating whether to include this somewhere as well
* Events: Installations, charter celebrations etc
* Reminders: Email reminders or 
* Location: Somewhat add a pin that opens either google maps or apple maps for better location support  
If there's anything else you're curious to hear about, let me know!
