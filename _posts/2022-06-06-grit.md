# Grit

Yesterday was about Grit. 

We often look for the easy way out but if we live this way we can never be great, we can never live to our full potential. 

In everything in life we must develop grit. We must toughen up and go through the obstacles. 

You can’t come out of it empty handed, there’s always a reward.
