# Ad Free Browsing (Almost)

I watch youtube and most of the web without ads. 

Some sites will require you to turn off the adblocker like the site I use to listen to podcasts.

Here's a list of extensions I use to adopt this

- [Adblock Plus]()
- [Adblocker Ultimate]()
- [Popup Blocker (strict)]()
- [Enhancer for YouTubeâ„¢]()

This is a growing list of tools I have come across, it may change with time and I will keep coming back to it to updated it.
