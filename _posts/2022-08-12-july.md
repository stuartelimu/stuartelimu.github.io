# July

Sadly, I'm releasing late once more, though I'd prefer it not to become a pattern since it makes it so difficult for me to recall things. 

As a result of my hectic schedule and inability to recall everything I didn't write down, I don't have much to say this time. 

This is a wrap up of all things I have been reading, watching, playing or listening to for the month of July.

### Watching ðŸ“º 
I enjoyed this [vlog](https://youtu.be/Ovxibp3_NE8) and for someone who is looking at getting into Youtube, everything about this video is somewhat what I want.

I binge-watched the third season of [The Good Doctor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6470478/). It made me realize how much perfection is needed to become a surgeon. I'm so impressed.

I'm happy that [Classroom of the Elite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7263328/) was given a second season of airtime. This is one of my favorite shows. 

I was able to watch a lot of summons, which was wonderful for my spirit and I hope I can continue to do so. Here are a few that I particularly liked.

- [Love Not the World â€“ Remember Lotâ€™s Wife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DorQXmlVDKQ) 
- [Faith Which Worketh By Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhx87gFRPdA)

### Reading ðŸ“–

I'm delighted I'm reading more each month. I thought I had lost it, but I've discovered that the quickest way to get back on track is to find a collection of articles in one location and see if the title and read-through length are appropriate for you. This has at least been useful. 

Hereâ€™s a list of top reads 

- [Ask, And You Shall Get](https://hulry.com/firesides/ask/)
- [Getting Lucky and Finding your Fox](https://sashalevage.substack.com/p/getting-lucky-and-finding-your-fox)
- [How I Finally Started Listening to Podcasts Every Day](https://hulry.com/building-podcasts-habit/)
- [You've been banned](https://vanschneider.com/blog/youve-been-banned/)


### Miscellaneous ðŸ¤ 

#### Nadia died :(
One morning, she wouldn't start. I realised the battery had died and I chose to let it rest.

I was able to fix it. Getting back on the road after nearly three weeks feels great even though I still have a few things to take care of, I'm crossing my fingers that it won't cost me everything this time. 

#### Whatâ€™s :P
I saw this on a certain YouTube video and I was curious luckily I found the [answer](https://www.quora.com/What-does-P-mean-1/answer/Hope-2206?ch=15&oid=125787379&share=96397da9&target_type=answer) on Reddit. 

:P means a face with a sticking out tongue(ðŸ¤ª). If you tilt your head left it will look like 2 eyes and then a mouth with a tongue sticking out.
People either use it as in a cheeky way or a flirty way or if theyâ€™re just being funny.

Lastly I found a few words to add to my(your) vocabulary 
- [Probable]() 
- [Pithy]()
