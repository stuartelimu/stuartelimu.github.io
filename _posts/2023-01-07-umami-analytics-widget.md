Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

<img class="rounded-1" width="100%" alt="Umami Analytics Widget" src="/assets/images/day-seven.jpg">

I have spent the past couple of days working on a widget to show analytics from my website on my iPhone Home Screen.

I saw this [tweet](https://twitter.com/chowdhuryrahul/status/1610281775431049218?s=46&t=LexzE7V5NK8gWXNkkBcaAg) from Rahul which gave me a little nudge and curiosity as well.

Apple introduced widgets in iOS 14 and they have been blowing up of late. 

I used an application called Scriptable which allows you to create and run scripts on iOS using Javascript.

This is not the first time I am trying this but I was so determined so I spent sometime going through the [umami api documentation](https://umami.is/docs/api) as well as the [scriptable documentation] not forgetting a couple of solutions on the internet and a couple of days I managed to get it to work 

I am pretty excited about this and I will be open sourcing the script and share it once done. 

Massive shoutout to [Yehuda](https://yehudab.com/), his [script](https://github.com/yehudab/scriptable/blob/master/Ackee.js) helped me out with the graphs.

Todayâ€™s bloganuary prompt was uninspiring so I decided to write about something different. Thanks for reading.
