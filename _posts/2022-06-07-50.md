# 50

[Grit]() was the 50th article this blog. I have written more than fifty articles and I am working on migrating all of them here but since I got serious here Iâ€™ll jot down some reflections and reminders

Books, I donâ€™t read as much anymore. Itâ€™s probably cuz of I donâ€™t use so much of my audio devices as much but Iâ€™m working on it. Currently Iâ€™m reading the hard thing about hard things this year I planned to read about 30 books. Iâ€™ll try to hit that. Itâ€™s another opportunity 

Writing, apart from the recent days id not written on over 2 months. Itâ€™s quite tough as well but I still got it. Iâ€™m glad some experiences always get me excited and Iâ€™m compelled to write about it. 

Schedule, this has taken so many turns but the Fear is how I sleep through my most productive hours this results to my days being shorter I donâ€™t like it

Reading, articles I mean Iâ€™ve dweeed into bookmarking lots of them instead of reading them. Iâ€™ve gotten so many open tanks and made promises to always go back but it never happens in return less motivated and less knowledgeable 

Code, I look at my charts and itâ€™s a low probably cuz of recent downs but Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m now working on some interesting projects and I got to keep at it

Exercises, this is such a low. I got to get back 

Podcasts, sigh i actually do miss them

I am shutting down the convertkit newsletter, Iâ€™ve not put much into it. I hav stue revue one up I hope it will have more love 

I am still leaving drafts and I hope when I read them and I donâ€™t like them I can make changes until itâ€™s ready

I am writing ruby now so I hope I can make some improvements here. Itâ€™s been overdue or even make a template 

Maybe Iâ€™m being hard on my self but if Iâ€™m not then Iâ€™m heading for destruction 

I hope this will act as a reminder and since we are halfway through the year I have another chance to level up. See you at 100 or sooner ðŸ˜ƒ

If you donâ€™t mind, I would love to know what habbits you are sticking to, what has helped and what failed.
