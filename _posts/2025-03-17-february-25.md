> The month of love - I bought a bouquet of flowers, I hope she was happy!

Welcome to this edition of my monthly recollection of somewhat everything that I am reading, watching or listening to, among other things that are happening around me. You can find other editions of this series here on the blog or subscribe to get a copy each time I publish a new edition.

### Reading &amp; Writing
> I read, a lot!

 Reading makes me want to write, a lot or even all the time. Despite the fact that I have only written one article so far but it’s because I read a lot and got the courage to sit at my desk and pour my mind out. It felt good, it feels good writing this too and I hope you enjoy reading it.

#### Blogs &amp; Articles
 I read a lot of blogs &amp; articles online, discovered a bunch of amazing authors that made the most use of my time reading and mostly inspiring me to write as well. Here’s ten articles I enjoyed reading:
* On the benefits of blogging: * <ins>[Donny Truong](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-donny-truong)</ins>*  talks about his blog.
* [Why avoiding temptation is better than resisting it](https://blog.medium.com/why-avoiding-temptation-is-better-than-resisting-it-aeb87bf44475)

I tweet about everything I read online as well as some of my thoughts on a couple of other things I come across. You can follow me on [Twitter]() in order to enjoy such content.

#### Books
![Reading is the creative center of a writer's life  I take a book](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/312fcf83-35be-45b7-bc00-1fd5f352ed07)

I always told myself that I would get back into audiobooks once I got a really good earphones. I don’t think that was right but nonetheless I splurged some money on the [CMF Buds Pro 2](https://cmf.tech/pages/buds-pro-2) as a present to myself. I think they are amazing despite a few loss of connection issues, they work great. Even with the audio gear in place, it was not until I came across this [tweet](https://x.com/AlexAndBooks_/status/1889770896740495486) that I actually got up and started reading again. 

It’s crazy how the little moments can birth new life.

I read two books in the month of February and already started on another book. I’m so proud I managed to get this far. You can check out my reading list incase you’re curious about what I am currently reading or what I have read in the past. 

### Watching 

Films
It’s been incredibly tough finding an awesome show or movie to binger during evenings after work or weekends as you wait for the games. I’ve Saif this and a lot of people around me are saying practically the same. So I’ve been casually rewatching a lot of films I enjoyed a while back, I picked this up from a friend last year and it’s working really nice thus far

The Brave; one to the few war series I’d not watched yet 
Love &amp; other drugs; it amazes me the range of this actor
Dumb money; I need to get more into stocks. This was an amazing watch b 
The gorge; waited for this and watched it first time it came out
Etched this morning be right after reading this book; the timing was perfect 
I rewatched a couple of movies too as i prepare to watch the new parts 
The accountant 

Youtube
Discovered a bunch of new YouTube channels with amazing documentary content.  
Bog: He has a unique style that I like, plus his little sikes at the end of some of his videos always get me 😆

### Listening 
This is somewhat getting shorter but I’ll work on getting it much more populated. I didn’t listen to much other than Phanero sermons that kept me going and productive through out the day
- Sermon 1
- Sermon 2
- Sermon 3

### Miscellaneous 

#### Nadia
> 2022 - 2025

Unfortunately Nadia broke down, I think it’s time that I actually let her go, sucks to say it but it’s been an incredible couple of years driving around this beast. So long, you taught me so much, so many lessons I’ll take on. Cheers mate, we had a good run

#### Health
I got back into running, I need to get another tracking app; it’s crazy that Adidas shut down its app along with all my data that I kept postponing to export. It’s always a sad reminder how big tech takes a lot of things away in snap; I’m going to look for an open source ish alternative  

At the back end of last year I was playing soccer week in, week out. I need to get back to that but first I need to make sure my heart doesn’t feel like it wants to leave my body


#### Keyboard Shortcuts
I usually find myself googling or asking AI for these shortcuts each time but I decided to include them in this section each time I come across something new. I took inspiration from Hulry’s newsletter as he shares really handy short cuts that he uses for his work flows.

`Ctrl + L`  
When you paste a command in the terminal or press the up arrow key to get a previous command on MacOS, use this command to remove or cut that line. 

I switched from VS Code to Sublime Text sometime last year so I’ve had to do a lot of relearning and adopting new shortcuts. Here’s one that I use quite a lot, sometimes I need to find and replace something in a particular file. Use `Cmd + D` to select the text or select by highlighting the text then press `ctrl + cmd + G` to highlight all matches and you can replace the text. There’s a couple of other ways shared on the [Sublime Forum](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/find-replace-all-text-on-page-via-keyboard/2099)

#### Numi
App of the Month 
I came across this app in January while watching a YouTube video. I admit I’ve not used it as much as I’d have loved to but it’s a really simple to use app that just works, does conversions etc. 

### Conclusion
It’s been quite a bullish month! I resumed reading, writing, running and a bunch of healthy habits I’d built up but sadly completely failed to continue with in the past year or so. Work wise, I think I’m back to being really productive compared to a couple of weeks ago which honestly relieves a lot of mental stress for me. 

This was a far from perfect month, a couple of things derailed my progress on so many fronts but a few tiny things made me happy.

In the end, I guess, it’s these little things that matter.
