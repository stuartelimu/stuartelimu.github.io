# Writing Notion Style

I love how notion lays out its posts that’s why I prefer it to so many other alternatives 

Using emojis vs svgs 
I tried using svgs but it was some sort of had kosh way. GitHub actually supports emojis and this is one of my favorite things on the internet unfortunately Twitter doesn’t support this 

I wish I could add so much to my workflow but I feel that would bloat up my workflow. I love the minimalist markdown style of things
