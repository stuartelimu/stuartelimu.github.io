Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

What brings you joy in life?

### Learning 

> You Can't Teach What You Don't Know and You Can't Lead Where You Won't Go - Katharina Joyce Watson

When I was younger, I learned how to ride a bicycle after a couple of falls and failed attempts. I was so excited, I would pick up the bike first thing in the morning. I got better over time, I started to ride with one hand and on a good day I would take my hands off the bike and let it roll. 

Whenever I learn something new, especially something exciting and not overly complicated, I experience tremendous joy similar to something like this. 

I love to learn, it gives me unimaginable joy knowing that I can answer a certain question because I read about it in a book, or when I can perfectly match a conversation end to end. 

Building a knowledge base on various topics takes a lot of work, but the reward is well worth it. 

### Teaching 
I agreed to tutor a few girls from one of the communities in basic computer education last year through our rotary program.
While some of them were more accustomed to using computers, the majority had never done so.
Since it was my first time teaching, I wasn't sure if I would be able to handle the job, but watching students advance from beginners to professionals gave me the drive I needed to continue and engage in further cohorts. 

Through education, I was able to make a positive impact on their lives, and I hope that I will have more opportunity to do the same in the many other domains in which I have expertise. 

I enjoy sharing all I've learnt, which is one of the reasons I started this blog.

Ideally, there are a ton of other things in my life that make me happy, such as spending time with my friends and family, traveling, earning money, and being in God's presence but I simply chose a couple of things to share here.
