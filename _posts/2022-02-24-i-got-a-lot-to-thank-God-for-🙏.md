# I got a lot to thank God for üôè

Just accepted a prayer invite.

Well, this didn't happen becuase of a weather issue but nonetheless gratitude still stands.

This is normally a post I would save for Sunday but I am learning not to put off things and doing them right away.

Conincidentally, there's some sort of WWIII happening right now, I am trying not to follow but it is almost impossible. It is everywhere. I pour out my hearts to everyone affected. This is one thing I am grateful for, usually it is taken for granted, it is not significant until you see what's happening else where. I am thankful for where i am physically, it is not always the best but i appreciate.

Mentally, I am struggling. I don't think I should be but once everything around you is really a mess it is tough to stay sane but i am grateful i am calm and staying positive.

Professionally, I made some big moves. I am grateful for the people I have met a long the way, for the character I have built personally and for the lessons I have picked up. Honestly they have opened so many doors for me, I got one job now, to level up and deliver.

There are quite a number of moving pieces right now, I don't understand all of it and I am trying not to. I am just grateful.

I have had some prayers answered after a couple of years, others after a few days and others not. I am grateful for it all. 

Definitely always going to come back here and show gratitude.

What are you grateful for today?
