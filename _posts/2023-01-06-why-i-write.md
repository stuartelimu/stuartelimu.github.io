Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

Why do you write?

### Personal
I primarily write for me, most of the articles are my own experiences that I have collected over the years. Some of it may be relatable while most of it may not resonate with you at all, which is perfectly okay. I write so that I can look back at all the lessons, experiences, tutorials that I have collected over the years. I wouldn't remember all of them if I didn't jot it down.

I hope to write my memoir sometime soon and each time I write an article I am one step closer to writing my own book. I draw a lot of motivation from authors like [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) who had been writing for years and put their knowledge into various books that they have written.

### Therapy 

Writing is therapeutic. I do not have a journal or anything of the sort so I treat this blog as a public journal. I dump notes on a lot of what has happened around me e.g I have a monthly series where I write about everything that I am reading, watching or listening to, among other things that are happening around me. You can read the latest edition [here](https://stuartelimu.me/december). 

Writing gives me a peace of mind and makes me feel better in case I'm feeling low.

### Audience

I write for everyone who wants to learn something from my personal and professional experiences. We all have different paths but I believe we can pick a leaf or two from each others experiences. I try to document each and everything covering various topics such as life, tech, books, relationships etc

I have received so many messages from people who relate with my content. They love the originality and phrasing and want to get into writing as well. It puts a smile on my face and motivates me to write more.

I am working on writing more in order to improve on the quality of these articles and make them more enjoyable to read.
