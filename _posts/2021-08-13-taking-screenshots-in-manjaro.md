# Taking Screenshots in Manjaro

Well I used to take screenshots by combining the `fn` + `prt sc` but this has a limited customization 

When Firefox rolled out it's snipping tool, I really wish I could use it for my other windows as well.

I did not know Manjaro comes with this application that lets you decide whether to take a screenshot of a particular window, entire desktop or customize your selection.

Open Screenshot application
