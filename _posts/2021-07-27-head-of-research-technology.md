# Head of Research & Technology
I’m currently the lead developer at Ad-iloits. 

I’m doing a Bsc in AI & ML with an ADSE in Software Engineering. I love what I do in addition I’m interested in maths , science, psychology, law, space among other things. 

In high school I dreamt of being a maths professor, I believe I still have it in me maybe not the profession but the same niche and goal 

I try and do a lot of learning. I’ve been blessed to be sorrounded by people who are where I want to be, people who are not yet where I want to be and people who are with me. 

I take a lot of notes but I wish I also took more recordings so I’d listen again and again like a podcast . The mind is not a place to keep stuff. 

In about 3 years from now I do not want to be coding as hard as I do now, I’d want a more managerial role with a balance of so many things but in order to get there I must grind as much to rise above the food chain and prove that I’m worth it

This is my accountability post. I’ll occasionally come here and evaluate myself 

What’s your dream role?
