# Mission Accomplished

It’s been a journey, I congratulate me 🤝

It's 16th of September again, my birthday anniversary.  

For most of the past year I've been in a dark space, the anxiety, the pain, the hurt its been crazy but every day for the past 365 days it has gotten easier and it is now the last thing on my mind. I share some of my favorite moments; This is how I am celebrating my wins 🏆

### Graduation 🎓

This was probably overdue but it finally came through. Almost felt like I couldn't make it. I [wrote](https://stuartelimu.medium.com/?p=f3968513771a) about my life at school a couple of months ago but this is a win for me, the guys and fam. We made it 🥳

I got a couple of more accolades on the way and I will look back to this when I am a doctorate. A luta continua 

### Rotaract 🎉

I am a proud member of the Rotaract Club of Kampala Muyenga Breeze, much love and shout out to [Marshud](https://twitter.com/marshud256) for the through pass on this one. For a while I'd been contemplating on a club to join but finally found a home at the breeze. I have had a couple of wonderful memories; hospitality, induction, sports gala, cancer run and I can't wait for more to come. 

There's so much knowledge shared, it feels so good to be here.
We have fellowships each Thursday, I would love to have you join us sometime. 😃

### Open Source ⚙️

I created a simple open source [web application](https://vaccination-centers.herokuapp.com/) to show vaccination centers in the country using information provided by the ministry of health as a way to make it more accessible for the citizens. There has been so much support from the Ugandan community and abroad and seeing people you have not met contributing to a product brings so much joy.

I really appreciate [Stephen S. Musoke](https://twitter.com/ssmusoke)  for sticking out for me and some advice here and there and to all the contributors much appreciate. 

Crazy how everything gets, I woke up to so many notifications and I can't thank everyone enough. Uganda to the wo

### Work 🧑🏽‍💻

I am honored to be associated with [Jiranihood](https://www.jiranihood.com/), [Adi-loits](https://www.adiloits.com/), [GridPower](https://gridpower.co.ug/) and a couple of other companies and clients. I really appreciate the opportunity for failure and growth.

I am starting businesses now, pulling boss moves with all these lessons that I am picking up from my experience. This is a privilege I am grateful to have. 

### Nightmares 😥

Nightmares came true; I am grateful for everything that went south, I am glad it did. It wasn't meant for me either way, it probably was the time to let go. Some hurt, some didn't, some I had to walk away. I am saying this with a heavy heart but I am not sad anymore, I have learned to live without myself, I have learned to congratulate others as I wait for my turn. It wouldn't have been this way without the challenges.

I am really grateful for the friends and family that have held me down. The support is priceless. 

Dear God, bless each and everyone of them, I'm not winning without the guys 🙏🏽

We go again 💪🏽
