# Learning From Subtitles 
> Yes, I do read and watch at the same time ðŸ˜‰

I am always asked how I get so good at words. I watch a lot of series maybe more than I should and mostly love it when subtitles are included. I do take my time to read and in this way I learn a lot of new words and vocabulary. I do watch a lot of spanish series too so I can now pick a couple of words too.

I always say to myself that this is how I will learn spanish.

Give it a try, tell me what's like.
