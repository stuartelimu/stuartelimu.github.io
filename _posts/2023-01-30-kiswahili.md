Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

<img class="rounded-1" width="100%" alt="Kiswahili" src="/assets/images/day-twenty-six.jpg">

I have had a chance to travel to Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi where you find the natives speak Kiswahili. I believe this is one of the languages I wish I could speak more fluently. 

I have work colleagues, friends and family too that speak it elegantly and I would love to do the same too. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to learn the language in high school so I'll have to do the learning myself which I hope will be more fun and fulfilling.

I think I should start watching shows in Kiswahili since I know a couple of words in Spanish because of a couple of Netflix shows.

With the East African Community becoming more real, itâ€™s more evident that Kiswahili could become our national language soon. We already have the anthem in Kiswahili so it's best I figure out how to speak it soon.

Other languages I wish I could speak include Spanish, French and Ateso.

Here is a new saying I learned today; Alea iacta est. It means the die is cast.
