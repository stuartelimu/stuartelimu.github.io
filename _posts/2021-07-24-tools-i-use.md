I'm a builder and a creator so I try to be platform independednt as possible. 

I'm currently using Manajaro Linux for both work and personal use. I have previously used Ubuntu & Windows, I have not actively used MacOS. I have used so many softwares, sites and services over the years but often I forget which ones worked for me. I'll now log it all here..

Here's a collection of the software that I use almost on a daily basis. 

- Manjaro Linux
- Cozy
- Notion
