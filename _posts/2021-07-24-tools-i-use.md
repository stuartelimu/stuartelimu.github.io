# Tools I Use

I am a builder and a creator so I try to be platform independent as possible. 

I am currently using Manjaro Linux for both work and personal use. I have previously used Ubuntu, Windows and I would love to try out various operating systems for both hobby and work purposes. I have used so many softwares, sites and services over the years but often I forget which ones worked for me. I'll now log it all here..
