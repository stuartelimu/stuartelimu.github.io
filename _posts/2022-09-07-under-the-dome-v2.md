title: Under The Dome V2

Unlike v1 this is a more detailed one to read. 
Made some changes which basically I’d love to have a look at

I may not have everything in one go but i believe in progress over perfection 

### Table of contents
I added a table of contents especially if you read articles on a table or landscape mode or pc you should be able to jump to various sections especially for long posts 

I plan to do something clever for Mobile screens but this will work for now 

### Navigation bar
I also added a navigation which although may not look like much but on mobile phones you can scroll to other links which I think is kinda cool. I got this idea from ghost theme but they seem to have abandoned that now 

### Pages
I added a dedicated blog page; for a long time articles were appearing on the home page which I’m okay with but I guess I wanted people to know more about me than landing on a couple of posts 

I’m still working on content for the home page so for now the articles will still apprear there’s as well

I added a link to my YouTube channel this is me getting intent to get back to creating content 

### Analytics
I added a self hosted analytics which for a longtime I’ve wanted to do but I found a great alternative that I managed to setup 

I managed to get my domain name back after two years of it being deactivated I’m glad because my website looks more legit now and easy to share 

What to look out for
- I am exploring a couple of fonts at the moment so I hope I can get one I’m comfortable with 
- The blue links are somewhat getting a bit too much so I’m probably going to look for a minimal color theme / pallet 
- I am currently trying to find a way to remove hardles between my writing 
- Adding a projects page to showcase the projects I’m working on currently this is what’s cooking 

### Summary
I am constantly trying to make things better so if you have any suggestions please reach out 

Additionally I’d love to see what your site looks like and I’d love to draw more inspiration from that too.
