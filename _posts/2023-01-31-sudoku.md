Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

This is not something I have learned recently but something that I have always wanted to learn.

I am a huge fun of board games or any kind of game that requires me to use my brain to the extreme. Over the years I have seen sudoku in the newspapers and almost everywhere but it always seemed so complicated for me to pick up.

> Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. - Wikipedia

Obviously, my curiosity has always gotten the better of me and I have always wanted to give it another go. When I came across this [tweet](https://twitter.com/austinvalleskey/status/1619754094830444546?s=46&t=DSjnzwDuYDYqwDeU4vdIPQ), it felt like it was a sign to get back to trying to learn how to play sudoku.

I wish there was a comprehensive guide to help ease the learning process because all the times I have tried I just found it so difficult to catch up. 

In case see you can tutor me or point me to any resources online, I’ll be more than happy to learn. Thanks!
