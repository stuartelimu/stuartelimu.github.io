# How To Pronounce Stue
 Most often than not , so many people get the pronounciation wrong. I managed to get a friend to help me record an audio that I can share here.
 
 <figure>
    <figcaption>Listen to the T-Rex:</figcaption>
    <audio
        controls
        src="/media/cc0-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3">
            Your browser does not support the
            <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</figure>
