Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

What is the earliest memory you have?

I was a little confused by this prompt. I wasn’t sure if it was the most recent memory or something else, but after reading a few posts, I got the gist.

In this article, I’ll share one of my memories. I don’t remember it all that vividly, but I remember enough to put it into writing.


When I was a little boy, I broke my leg while running in the sitting room. I was using a bedsheet to cover my face while I slid. I slid so hard that I broke my femur. I went through a ton of pain, and it was dreadful. 

It is hard for me to remember what happened afterwards, but I am certain I cried so much.

I don't remember being taken to the hospital but I had a cast for a very long time and I stayed in my parents room as they helped me do everything. It must have been scary for them seeing me that way. It was reckless of me 

It's funny how a couple of years later I almost broke my ankle in a similar fashion and can't really play any physical sport now. I'm probably too scared I'll get injured and go through all this again.
