# How I write using Telegra.ph

[Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/) is a publishing tool that lets you create richly formatted posts. It was [launched](https://telegram.org/blog/instant-view#telegraph) by Telegram in 2016.

It allows you to publish articles anonymously without the need to create an account unlike other platforms like Medium. Alternatively you can use your Telegram account to sign in and publish your articles. 

I am arguably in a platform dump and would love to try out a new platform and this one checks all the boxes and since I’m a huge fun for the telegram team I couldn’t wait to try it out.

### Writing Anonymously

To get started, open [telegraph](https://telegra.ph/) from your web browser.

You'll be presented with such a page with a couple of placeholders which allow you to type a title, description and author name.
