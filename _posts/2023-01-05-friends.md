What is a treasure that’s been lost?

> if you’re lucky, you might get three real friends in your entire life - unknown

This is dedicated to all the friends I made in school, on social media and work. Thank you for all the memories, I miss you so much ❤️

### School 
I believe most of our first friends are made during our time in school. We share a lot in common, learn from each other, create groups and always do everything together.

Each year or term is different, it comes with various challenges and after a couple of years together we change schools and that bond is broken. We meet at the university many years later, try to make the friendship work again but we realise we are completely different people. 

We become the people we used to know.

### Social Media 
> Accept friend request ?

I grew up in an era where Facebook was cool. We’d make so many friends and chat throughout the holidays before the new term started. If you were lucky you’d still chat again the next holiday but two or three months at school with your friends is no match to two or three weeks chatting with someone else online. 

Eventually we lose that connection and consequently lose the friendship. 

### Work
We usually make friends at our places of work. There’s so much talk about how people you work with are not your friends rather workmates which is true to some extent but personally I’ve made friends at various work places who I still treasure and relate with although not all of them stick around. 

Distance takes a toll on the friendship and next thing we know we’re not as close as we were. Personally I'm trying to reconnect with a couple of friends who really made life worth living during a very low point in my life, maybe we'll reconnect maybe not.

I could add family friends, friends you met at church or a function or people who were once your neighbours all these were treasures at a certain time but are now lost 💔
