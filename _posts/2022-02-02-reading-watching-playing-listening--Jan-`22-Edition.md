# Reading, Watching, Playing, Listening: 2021

This is a wrap up of all things I have been reading, watching, playing or listening to for the month of January '22.

I hope this will make writing an end of year review a little easier this year. Iâ€™ll always look back to this and make a better wrap up. 

### Watching ðŸ“º

I spent a relatively less time behind a screen i managed to catch a few series Hanna, Alex Rider & Dr Bull which is my utter favorite. I resonate a lot with the everything in the series. 

Undoubtedly YouTube has been a constant mainly tutorials, home setups since Iâ€™ve been planning a move but also a lot self help videos. 

Iâ€™ll share a couple of my favorites:

[How to Study for Exams - The STic Framework for Effective Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5A26Sc63F0)

[Finding yourself is not how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuN1S-gWBfA)

Unfortunately I havenâ€™t caught as many games from AFCON but itâ€™s semifinals week, I guess itâ€™s time to catch the games and root for some of my favorite players. 

### Listening ðŸŽ§

I discovered Phora, heâ€™s such a talented rapper. He gives me NF vibes and surely we are all going through a lot in life. His music makes it easier to feel not alone. Checkout my favorite [track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5jAwJzqdvs) from his latest album.

Additionally I revisited some tracks from Polo G. When I was down and hurting I slept on his lyrics, Iâ€™ve been knocked down a bit and had to revisit a couple of verses.

I didnâ€™t listen that much to podcasts mainly because I lost my Bluetooth earbuds but my favorite podcast Iâ€™ve listened to in a while has been [Invest Like the Best with Patrick O'Shaughnessy](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/invest-like-the-best-with-patrick-oshaughnessy/id1154105909)

### Reading ðŸ“– 

I listened to an author over a podcast who read about 10 journal articles per day. I would argue I read more than that but the whole point is we have to read as much as we can in order to write. 

Hereâ€™s an interesting graphic from David Perell on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1411871612702543872?s=20&t=HmP1Ua38QgcRM7IiEQL-Mg)

Top reads this month:

[More important than money](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/coin/more-important-than-money)

[Nithin Kamath's story](https://nithinkamath.me/)

[Dealing with Physical and Emotional Pain](https://sarkar.blog/posts/dealing-with-pain/)

[Becoming a Better Writer in Tech](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/becoming-a-better-writer-in-tech/)

Unfortunately I havenâ€™t read a book Iâ€™m the past month but as a custom I always read Atomic Habbits at the beginning of each year since 2020.

My goal this year is to read 30+ books including books from African authors.

### Miscellaneous ðŸ¤ 

I started another [newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/stuartelimu) on revue which is visible on my Twitter profile. I believe this will make it easier for my audience to find my content since Iâ€™m big time on Twitter. 

Iâ€™ve accumulated over 220+ push ups over the past couple of days in a quest to get healthier.

Well, itâ€™s a wrap. I am curious about what you have been reading, watching, playing and listening. You can reach [out](https://twitter.com/stuartelimu) and share or discuss anything that was of interest to you.
