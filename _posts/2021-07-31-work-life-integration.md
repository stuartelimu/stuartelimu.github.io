# Work Life Integration
> Work, life, balance is a myth üôç

### Work Life Balance
I believe balancing work and life is some form of a myth at least for software developers. I am not married it could be different but in the two years I have been working professionally I have often found my self integrating work into my life or vice versa. 

I often find myself at a party with a tone of work to do; after the party I get back, freshen up and get my work done. It's a workflow I have gotten used to such that I can spend a great time with my friends and family then get work done on the same day.

In this career where everthing rapidly changes by the second; I can't afford days off, it's wild but I have tried and I have failed; it doesn't work for me.

### Work Life Integration

This is how I integrate my life and work together
- I joined rotary this year at the amazing club of muyenga breeze; I meet a lot of new people with various professions and I see the world quite differently. Additionally I get a couple of clients from our fellowships and I get to do some good in the community. I love communities and I love to build them. Here is also where I occassionaly have my enjoyments üçª
- I watch a whole tone of series, youtube maybe more than I should but not just any series; It's always a series that is in relation to what I am studying or learnig and I always draw inspiration which gets me going.
