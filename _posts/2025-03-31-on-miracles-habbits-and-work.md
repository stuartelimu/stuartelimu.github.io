title: On Miracles, Habbits & Work
---

Welcome to this edition of my monthly recollection of somewhat everything that I am reading, watching or listening to, among other things that are happening around me. You can find other editions of this series here on the blog or subscribe to get a copy each time I publish a new edition.

### On Miracles üôè

There's a couple of things that I have struggled with for a while, things that only a fraction of people know about, things which I cannot share but I am compelled to write about my testimony even when everything is somewhat redacted. Maybe I'll get the courage to share it sometime.

  

Phaneroo Service 525 changed the trajectory if my life. When I walked in, I found Apostle Grace asking us to write down whatever was disturbing us and put a date besides it and mark it as the day it left. I did, I believed and I also prayed a long online.

  

On Saturday morning I went for a run and listened to the entire sermon and I understood the magnitude of what was preached on Thursday. It was a great run but more importantly it was a sermon that changed my life.

  

Later that afternoon, I got into a scenario that I couldn't get myself out of but I asked God to not let me be a liar and He didn't disappoint. I felt a great sigh of relief, I couldn't believe what I'd just seen happen in that moment. I made sure I wrote it down somewhere and thanked God for my testimony. I told myself I will give God time this year and I have started listening to sermons each day before I get started with any work. It‚Äôs quite unfortunate that I am not didn‚Äôt really documenting everything I am learning but this is my cue to start.

  

Dear God, thank you for Apostle Grace Lubega, Phaneroo and Brooke; who initially invited me on a random Thursday to go and pray. God bless you

### Reading & Writing üìö

I didn‚Äôt read as much as I would have hoped whether blogs or books but I am writing this on a Monday evening from my phone then I'll make a couple of updates later while I'm at my desk. It's so simple and effortless but most times I shrug it off as something that will take me ages. Hopefully telling myself this will nudge me to actually write more.

  

I completed The Power of Moments by Author, a book I started reading towards the end of last month. It definitely took me longer than it was supposed to because I procrastinated a lot on the days I wasn't feeling like it until I reminded myself about the 10 minute rule; I just need to read for 10 minutes each day. It can be at any time and place, either before bed, while doing dishes or even during my evening runs. I'm glad to say that I managed to complete the book and I'm excited to start another book tomorrow.

  

I made a decision to resume reading the Bible. Last year I went as far as the book of Numbers, I'm hoping to go much further this time round. I just need to do 10 minutes and I'll make it

### Watching üì∫

I watched a handful of movies but the movie Fractured stuck with me for a while. I couldn't believe what I just watched. I had to ask Grok to actually explain the ending to me because deep down I couldn't bring myself to believe what I'd seen. Ray was actually delusional. It was so sad, I honestly expected him to be a hero but I was wrong. Overall it was a great movie nonetheless.

  

was sad but E mind bending movie even though I thought it was one of those series but it wasn‚Äôt

I am currently watching The Bureau and I just completed the second season. I can‚Äôt believe I put it off for so long because it's so good. Other than the fact I can now spell the word Bureau correctly, I think Mathieu Kassovitz is such a great actor. I believe there's a couple of lessons we can pick out of everything that he did and how he handled it. It's a 10/10 series

  

### Home Office Upgrade üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I bought the Ecoflow River Pro. I had initially wanted the River 2 Max as it was the one I could afford at the time but when I made payment, I was unaware that it was out of stock and I'd have to wait a couple of weeks until it was available. I was sad and mad but every cloud has a silver lining. Once the boss found out that I'd made payment, he gave me an offer, that If I could make a small top up I could get the river 2 pro which was already available and I'd pick it up the next day. Which i did and this was one of the best financial decisions of my money in a long time.

  

This was one of the items on my list which was long over due. It was an idea I'd never really seen to fruition but i finally bit the bullet and I‚Äôm really happy as i can work as much as I can even without electricity ; last year I think I lost a bit of trust especially when i needed to get some work done but I didn‚Äôt have electricity

  

I had this incident where I was literally 1 minute before my call and my electricity died; I quickly switched the router to run off the ecoflow and I was back ready for the calll; such little moments made it worth the expense but also have a really calm mind when there‚Äôs no electricity

  

Out of frustration I bought a cable but they delivered a different one; I wasn‚Äôt sure a refund would work but it was returned even less than 15 mins; I‚Äôm glad I opted for mobile money option because bank would take ages

  

I went awhwd a picked up the actual cable and ine only used it for a few hours it‚Äôs working perfectly well even when I‚Äôm running off my ecoflwo

  

The goal for my Routier is to hook up a all powrtbamk they can power is up; but I haven‚Äôt gotten to it yet

### Health ü´Ä

Unfortunately I spent largely of those month with a cold so I didn‚Äôt run as much as I needed to but I discovered couch to 5k and I‚Äôm going to kick off the streak; I feel I can do a custom challenge but hopefully by the end of next month I‚Äôd like to run my 5k. I mapped my route already so Godspeed ü§ûüèΩ

  

### Conclusion

A lot happened and maybe a lot didn‚Äôt but I was at peace, mentally, physically and spiritually. I am learning to sacrifice a couple of things in order to live a certain life that I need. Change is hard but I think I'll get there.

  

Cheers!
