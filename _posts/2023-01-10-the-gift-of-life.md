Welcome to Bloganuary! I am participating in a writing challenge hosted by Wordpress. Each day in January, I will publish a new article based on a prompt provided by the team at Wordpress. You can join the challenge [here](http://wordpress.com/bloganuary).

What is the most memorable gift you have received?

I’m forever grateful 🙏🏽

I’m happy for each hurdle I’ve overcome and I know a lot more are on the way.

Sometimes nothing ever goes as planned and I get in my head a little.
