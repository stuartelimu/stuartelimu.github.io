What is something you want to achieve this year?

### Health

> Mentally, Physically & Spiritually 

I made huge progress on my health last year but I still have a lot to improve on. I can't run a mile without my ankle hurting or without panting like I'm about to die or without my chest running mad. This year I want my health to be off the charts. 

I want to gain more mass, gain more weight, go to the gym basically, improve my skin basically I want to take care of my body.

I want to know God more. 

### Wealth
One of my goals this year is be financially independent, meaning I can walk into a place and get anything with little worry of the dent on my credit card. It may not be complete independence yet but I believe this can be the beginning.

I have read a lot of books regarding this, listened to lots of advice from so many people who are somewhat where I want to be and I believe it's time to put all that into action. It's time to try, fail and learn but most importantly succeed. 

I am working towards a work promotion and starting a business maybe more than one. They say you can’t get rich on salary alone but I am not sure I believe this entirely but I won't stick around to find out so I’m working on various revenue steams.

I want to be wealthy but I don’t want to lose myself in the process.

### Happiness

I want to reconnect with my friends, relatives, best friends and figure out this thing called love. 

I want to travel the world, go on dates and learn new hobbies. 

I want to be happy with my work, studies and everything I am spending my time on.  

I want to learn something new, live somewhere new and stare back at my life in amazement!

I want my friends and family to be happy. 

I want to be happy but I need to be wealthy and healthy as well.
