# August Reads

I read over 10 articles in the month of august I figured I’d have my own bookmarks section to always refer to 

This would normally be in my browsers bookmarks but that is always abandoned 

- [Advice · Patrick Collison]()
- [The unpleasant essentials - Josh Pigford]()
- [](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-valuable-things-everyone-should-know)
- [Letter #36: On friendship - by Ali Montag]
- [Startup Energy Theory | Daniel Gross]()
- [](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/expiring-vs-permanent-skills/)
- [The Imperfectionist: Too many needles](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI#/main)
- [Some Advice Gathered from People Smarter than Me](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/some-advice-gathered-from-people)
- [Pushing And Pulling Goals | Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/18/pushing-and-pulling-goals/)
