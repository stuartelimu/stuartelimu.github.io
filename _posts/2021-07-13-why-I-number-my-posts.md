# Why I number my posts.

```
I have currently written {{ site.posts | size }} articles.
```

I recently got into the habbit of tracking whatever I'm doing. In the past, this was not something that I would do. I'd do so many things and keep it in my head but if history serves me right. My head is not where to keep things.

I see a lot of before and after stories or pictures of celebrities, on twitter it is "how it started" vs "how it is going" or "how it ended".

I want that, I want to look back at how far I've come. 

I am numbering all my posts as a way of tracking my progress with the most recent post being at the top. This was something I put into consideration while hacking together this page.

I personally visit my blog a lot to go through my articles and it gives me chills when the numbers are adding up. I love it, I love the progress I have made.
