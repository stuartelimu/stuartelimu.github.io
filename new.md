# Hi, I’m stue. 

I am a full-time learner of life, writer, software engineer and content creator. 

This is my personal website, documenting all of the articles I have written, everything I am building and generally what is going on [inside my brain](). I am trying to start a couple of businesses along the way in a bid to live a better life and leave an inheritance for my children’s grandchildren ( verse )

Thanks for stopping by, I would surely love to repay catered so please share a link to your website or blog on Twitter and I’ll sure my have a look. 

Posts I’ve enjoyed writing...
