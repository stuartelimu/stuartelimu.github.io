# Hi, I’m stue. 

I am a full-time learner of life, writer, software engineer and content creator but overall I love solving problems by figuring things out. This is my personal website, documenting all of the articles I’ve written, things I’m building and generally everything that is going on inside my brain.

Along the way I’m trying to start a couple of businesses in a bid to live a better life and leave an inheritance for my children’s grandchildren ( verse ) 

I have a monthly newsletter where I share a couple of things that I’ve been upto 

Thanks for stopping by, I would surely love to repay catered so please share a link to your website or blog on Twitter and I’ll sure my have a look. 

Posts I’ve enjoyed writing...
