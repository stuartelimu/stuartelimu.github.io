# Hi, I’m stue. 

I am a full-time learner of life, writer, software engineer and content creator. 

This is my personal website, documenting all of the articles I have written, things I am building and generally everything that is going on [inside my brain](). Along the way I am trying to start a couple of businesses in a bid to live a better life and leave an inheritance for my children’s grandchildren ( verse )

Thanks for stopping by, I would surely love to repay catered so please share a link to your website or blog on Twitter and I’ll sure my have a look. 

Posts I’ve enjoyed writing...
