# Hi, I’m stue. 

I am a full-time learner of life, writer, software engineer and [content creator](https://www.youtube.com/@stuartelimu). 

On this site I document all the [articles](/blog) that I have written, books I've read as well as everything I am working on and the lessons learned along the way. I am constantly trying to start a couple of businesses in a bid to live a better life and [leave an inheritance for my children’s children](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+13%3A22&version=NIV)

Thanks for stopping by! I would love to repay courtesy, so please share a link to your website or blog on Twitter and I will have a look.
