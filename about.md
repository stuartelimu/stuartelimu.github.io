# About

Hi, I‚Äôm <a title="Stuart Elimu" href="/">stue</a>. I am a lead software engineer, techie and [content creator](). 

I'm currently working on a number of [projects](/work), such as [@KOPSPN]() and [Find My Rotary](), in an effort to improve my quality of life, leave something for the future grandkids of my children, while also having fun and making a positive impact on the world üåç

I love writing about technology, cars and everything that I am learning. You can read every single article I've ever written on my [blog](/blog), which covers a wide range of subjects that interest me.
